% Homework_06: Images_01
% Assigned: 01/27/2015 
% Due: 02/03/2015
% Create a script (.m file) which calculates the following:

% Problem{01}: Create a (300 x 300) bitmap white (255) image with a black 
% (0) border to simulate a "picture frame".  The frame should be 10 units in
% from the edge of all sides.  Save this image as "ImageFrame.bmp".  Now,
% insert the "Blaze_GrayScale.jpg" into the "picture frame".  Find the center of the
% Parrot picture, and the center of the frame and place the Parrot.  Save
% this file as "Blaze_with_Frame.bmp".
% Input: "Blaze_GrayScale.jpg"
% Output: "ImageFrame.bmp","Blaze_with_Frame.bmp"
% Filename: "Blaze_with_Frame.m

% Problem{02}: Take a tasteful image of your choice, color or black and
% white and apply what you have learned about images.  Experiment!  Make
% three significant changes to your original image.  Everything must be 
% done in a script (no file-->save as).  Be prepared to be called on
% (random) by Tuesday's class (02/03/2014 5:00 p.m.) to explain what you
% did (and for your image to be shown).
% Filename: ImageMorph.m
% Input: step_00.bmp (or .jpg, etc...)
% Output: step_01.bmp, step_02.bmp, step_03.bmp (or .jpg, etc...)
