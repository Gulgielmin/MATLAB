% Due: 02/13/2015
% Create a script (.m file) which calculates the following:

% Problem{01}: Clean up the BlackAndWhiteCheckerBoard.bmp by making it a true
% bi-color image where
% ColorOne >= 128
% ColorTwo < 128
% Filename: SimpleImageCleaner.m
% Input: ColorOne, ColorTwo, BlackAndWhiteCheckerBoard.bmp
% Output: CleanCheckerBoard, CleanCheckerBoard.bmp <-- not a typo!

% Problem{02}: Using Flowers_Color.jpg create three separate images, one
% for each layer (red, green blue).
% Filename: RGB.m
% Input: 'Flowers_Color.jpg'
% Output: 'Flowers_Red.jpg', 'Flowers_Green.jpg', 'Flowers_Blue.jpg'
%         Flowers_Red, Flowers_Green, Flowers_Blue

% Problem{03}: Using Flowers_Color.jpg create a new color image (160 x 160 x 3) 
% that successfully crops one of the flowers in the original image.
% Filename: Crop.m
% Input: 'Flowers_Color.jpg'
% Output: 'Flowers_Cropped.jpg', Flowers_Cropped

% Problem{04}: Create a script (.m file) which 'encrypts' your first name 
% using a limited example of ROT13.  You are required to use the ASCII letters from 97 to 122.  
% Both your input and output must fall in the approved range.  The output 
% must be returned as a string (not as an array of numbers).
% Filename: encrypt_first_name.m
% Input: first_name
% Output: first_name_encrypted

% Problem{05}: Create a script (.m file) which 'encrypts' any text using the 
% first letter of your name.  You are required to use the ASCII letters 
% from 97 to 122.  Both your input and output must fall in the approved 
% range.  The output must be returned as a string (not as an array of numbers).
% Filename: encrypt_some_text.m
% Input: first_name, some_text
% Output: some_text_encrypted

% Problem{06}: Create a script (.m file) which 'decrypts' any text using the 
% first letter of your name.  You are required to use the ASCII letters 
% from 97 to 122.  Both your input and output must fall in the approved 
% range.  The output must be returned as a string (not as an array of numbers).
% Filename: decrypt_some_text.m
% Input: first_name, some_text
% Output: some_text_decrypted
