% Problem{04}: Given the equation y = cos(x) + i*sin(x), calculate the
% values for y at four given values of x.  It would be useful to  play with
% the values of x to understand how matlab treats complex numbers.
% Filename: complex_numbers.m
% Input: x1, x2, x3, x4
% Output: y1, y2, y3, y4


x1 = 3;

x2 = 4;

x3 = 5;

x4 = 2;
%% Equation
y1 = cos(x1) + (i*sin(x1));
y2 = cos(x2) + (i*sin(x2));
y3 = cos(x3) + (i*sin(x3));
y4 = cos(x4) + (i*sin(x4));
