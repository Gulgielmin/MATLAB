% Problem{03}: Slope of the line.  Assuming values for PointA and PointB,
% where PointA is (xA,xB) and PointB is (xB,yB),calculate the slope 
% of the line that passes through those points.
% Filename: line_slope.m
% Input: xA, yA, xB, yB
% Output: slope


%%The slope m of the line through the points (xA, yA) and (xB, y 2) is
%%given by m = (yB - yA)/(xB - xA)

%First point

xA = 4;

yA = 1;

%second point

xB = 7;
yB = 2;

slope = (yB - yA)/(xB - xA);
