%% Class_05_Preparation: Arrays

%% How are arrays different/same as vectors?


% Example that we already know...
% Cartesian - x and y axis 
% n x m collection of data (2 dimensional)
% not limited to dimensions

% same data type 

% created similarly to vectors

% access similarly to vectors
% rows - first dimension
% columns - second dimension


% first row and first column
ArrayD(2,1) % second row and first column
ArrayD(1,2) % first row and second column
